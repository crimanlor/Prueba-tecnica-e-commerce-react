# Platzi React Practical Course - Technical Challenge

This repository is part of the technical challenge for the **Platzi React Practical Course**. The project is developed step by step through various **issues** and **pull requests** provided by the instructor.

## Overview

In this project, I am implementing various React features, including state management, routing, and local storage integration, based on the provided instructions and challenges. The project is built with:

- **React** for building the user interface
- **React Router** for handling routing and navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling the application using utility-first classes
- **Vite** for a fast development environment and bundling

## Development Process

- Follow along with the issues and corresponding pull requests as outlined by the instructor.
- Each issue will include a specific task or feature that I will develop and submit as a pull request.
- The objective is to improve the project incrementally, adding new features or fixing bugs as I work through the course content.
